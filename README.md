# SitsiTeX
## What is SitsiTeX?
In regular need to make new songbooks and tired of reinventing the wheel many times over, I started developing this for my personal use in order to easily generate good-looking songbooks for Sitsits. I then decided I might as well share it with other songmasters in order to simplify the process and make the result more elegant using the power of Latex. This comes with the added benefit of being able to share a common song library for all users, further spreading the love for one of our favorite activities.e all your pull requests to `dev`, not `master`. I will apply changes to `master` from `dev` myself once I have made a changelog and tested everything fits together nicely.

## Packages needed
SitsiTeX relies on a specific package, [`songs.sty`](http://songs.sourceforge.net/), for most of the formatting. Please use the installed version.
