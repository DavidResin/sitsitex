(gentlemen)
Shouldn't it be a punch tonight?
I have been expecting to eat long.
The punch came and made me happy and seldom,
the punch will come after you once?

HAVE A 2ND VERSE FOR MEN

AAAAA
(ladies)
The punch is okay
but it's nothing for me.
for the punch lacks bouquet!
So that's what you were going to give,
I have a better idea.  

AABBB
For cognac it makes me rarely,
Rémy Martin and Martell, 
Courvoisier may well go.  
Can I get Hennessy, 
get it with Renault!

3RD VERSE FOR EACH?

Il approche le moment, avant de m’aventurer,  
Je bois tout en équipant mon beau sac d’aventurier,  
Que faut-il que je prépare ? Ai-je assez pour m’équiper?  
Au milieu de ces déboires, j’ai bien envie de pleurer,  
Caaaaaar...  

bois, boire, aboyer, boite, eboua, flamboie, pourboire, hautbois, framboise, déboires, boa

Des gants qui donnent des ulcères, des framboises pour le dessert,
  
J’ai une épée molle, des bottes qui rigolent,  
Un bouclier rose et bleu, une armure qui craint le feu.  
J’ai un casque en tôle, une ceinture qui colle,  
Un caillou défectueux, une arbalète pour les vieux.  
Et la suite n’est pas mieux...  
  
J’ai des gants débiles, des sardines à l’huile,  
Une cape qui sent le bouc, un chapeau qui me rend plouc,  
J’ai un arc en laine, un chandail en chêne,  
Un couteau de 20 kilos, une hache pour fendre l’eau,  
Et la suite c’est cadeau...  
  
J’ai une bouillotte, une potion de flotte,  
Un parchemin pour vêler, des godasses qui font danser,  
J’ai l’anneau magique qui rend alcoolique,  
Et cet anneau le voici, grâce à lui je suis ici!
  
## In Heaven
###### inheaven
  
In Heaven there is no beer,  
That's why we drink it here.  
And when we are gone from here,  
Our friends will be drinking all our beer.  
  
In Heaven there is no wine, (no wine?)  
Well that's why we drink moonshine.  
And when we drink moonshine,  
tastes mighty fine!  

## Gotta catch 'em all!
#### To the tune of "Pokérap"
###### stds

I wanna be the best there ever was,
To trigger all tests, yeah that's my cause!

Syphilis
AIDS
Hepatitis
Leprosy
Chlamydia
Gonorrhea
Herpes
HPV
Warts

Catch 'em, catch 'em, gotta catch 'em all, STDs!

Catch 'em, catch 'em, gotta catch 'em all,
Gotta catch 'em all, STDs!

I'll search across the land, look far and wide,
Release from my hand the power that's inside!

At least one hundred fifty or more to see,
To be a Pokémon master is my destiny!

## Tarzan & Jane  
###### tarzan  
  
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine,  
Sippin' on a bottle of Vodka double-wine.  


  
She whispered to him "boy you look mighty fine",

ESN is a mighty good 


Really puts the "" in 

Roses are red and violets are blue,
Liquor costs less than a dinner night for two.

You're the cutest lad that I ever did see,
I wouldn't mind a share of your lovely company.

Although this tune dragged for way too long,
I still have jokes that are morally wrong.

My buddy once said "dude, you look really gay",
Now we're happily married with children on the way.

Straight Prides Parades in the US of A,
Say what you want, but those are pretty gay.
