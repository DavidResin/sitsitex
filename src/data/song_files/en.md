## March of the Water-Boys  
##### Code: marchofthewaterboys  
  
This we swear upon our lives or even death  
That we will not drink at all that devilish alcohol  
You may come and smell all of our brothers’ breath  
But you'll see our edge is straight!  
  
Hooray, us jolly water playboys  
We are sober everyday, boy  
You're hung over? What a shame, boy.  
Hooray, us jolly water playboys  
We're as fresh as one can be (indeed!)  
  
## Far Over  
##### Code: farover  
  
Far over the Misty Mountains cold,  
To dungeons deep and caverns old.  
We must away, ere break of day,  
To find our long forgotten gold.  
  
The pines were roaring on the heights,  
The winds were moaning in the night.  
The fire was red, it flaming spread,  
The trees like torches blazed with light.  
  
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,  
While hammers fell like ringing bells.  
In places deep, where dark things sleep,  
In hollow halls beneath the fells.  
  
Far over the Misty Mountains grim,  
To dungeons deep and caverns dim.  
We must away, ere break of day,  
To win our harps and gold from him!  
  
## Dear Friends

My dear friends our grand feast will begin here,

All night drinks down our throats we’ll be pouring,  
We’ll remember good times, not the boring.  
:;: Through the ceiling our song will be soaring  
Finnish spirits are much more than good :;:  
  
When friends drink too much with one another  
They make new memories more than rather.

We won’t run out of drinks, maybe food :;:

Syphilis, it just started with a simple kiss.  
Now it hurts to even take a piss...  
Oh how did I get syphilis?  
  
Why her box was sick,  
I don’t know she wouldn’t say.  
Now my dripping dick,  
Won’t get hard like yesterday.  
  
Yesterday, my cock was always coming out to play.  
Now it needs two weeks to hide away.  
Oh I believe in yesterday.  
  
Birth control, all my troubles seem so far away,  
When I’m going up my girlfriend's hole.

It was unexpected pregnancy.  
Oh, I believe in birth control.  
  
Why, I had to come.  
I don’t know she wouldn’t blow.  
I stayed in too long,  
How I long for birth control.  
  
Leprosy, that old rotten man just touched my knee,  
Now my flesh is falling off of me.  
Oh, I think I got leprosy.  
  
Suddenly, I’m just half the man I used to be,  
There are pieces coming off of me.  
Yes, leprosy came suddenly.  
  
Why’d my arm fall off?  
I don’t know, no one will say.  
I know something’s wrong,  
‘Cause my leg just walked away.  
  
## This Feeling  
##### Code: thisfeeling  
- To the tune of “Everytime we touch”  
  
I still feel the symptoms,  
Do you get them too?  
Am I just different or is it a flu?  
I should go see a doctor, so I could be sure  
But I just don’t want to get cured!  
  
'Cause every time I drink, I get this feeling  
With every single sip I swear I can fly!  
Can’t you feel my thirst build so  
I want it to grow,  
So I can drink some more  
  
‘Cause every time I drink I feel extatic  
And when I’ve drunk one down I run to the bar  
I need to have some more drinks fast  
I want this to last  
Tonight I’m sure I’ll score!

Swedes export IKEA,  
Ukraine exports Crimea,  
Germany exports refugees,  
All Finland does is send them back!  
  
Here we would've sung of the UK,  
But they went on and did a stupid thing they call "Brexit",  
All hope is lost for England,  
But Scots and Irish: welcome back!

Wake him up with a glass of Vodka...

## The Engineers' Drinking Song  
##### Code: engineersdrinkingsong  
- To the tune of “The Son of a Gambolier”  
  
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the Engineers,  
We can, we can, we can, we can, demolish forty beers.  
Drink rum, drink rum, drink rum all day, and come along with us,  
'Cause we don't give a damn for any old man who don't give a damn for us!  
  
A maiden and an Engineer were sitting in the park,  
The Engineer was working on some research after dark,  
His scientific method was a marvel to observe,  
While his right hand held the figures, his left hand traced the curves.  
  
We are, we are, we are, we are...  
  
Princeton's run by Wellesley, and Wellesley's run by Yale  
And Yale is run by Vassar, and Vassar's run by tail  
Harvard's run by stiff pricks, the kind you raise by hand  
But M.I.T. is run by Engineers, the finest in the land  
  
We are, we are, we are, we are...  
  
MIT was MIT when Harvard was a pup,  
And MIT will be MIT when Harvard's time is up,  
And any Harvard Son of a bitch who thinks he's in our class,  
Can pucker up his rosy lips and kiss the Beaver's ass.  
  
We are, we are, we are, we are...  
  
A Harvard lad in robes was clad and set to graduate.  
A pompous gleaming spectacle he was upon that date.  
But not a quarter hour after he got his degree,  
He was serving fries to engineers from good old MIT!  
  
We are, we are, we are, we are...  
  
An MIT surveyor once found the gates of Hell,  
He looked the devil in the eye, and said "You're looking well".  
The devil looked right back at him, and said "Why visit me -  
You've been through Hell already; you went to MIT!"  
  
We are, we are, we are, we are...  
  
Rapunzel let her hair down for two suitors down below,  
So one of them could grab a hold and give the old heave-ho.  
The prince began to climb at once, but soon came out the worst,  
For the Engineer rode up a lift, and reached Rapunzel first.  
  
We are, we are, we are, we are...  
  
3.141 is pi and 2.7's e.  
The root of -1 is i the speed of light is c.  
And I can rattle off these numbers 'til infinity,  
But the only thing that's constant is the work at MIT!  
  
We are, we are, we are, we are...

## What She's Got  
##### Code: whatshesgot  
  
_(Songmaster solo:)_  
Being gay has its problems, it's true,  
But being straight has its problems too.  
I met this girl,  
And she's just great,  
But the problem is that I am straight.  
You ask "How can this be?"  
Sing along and you will see:  
  
_(Everyone:)_  
She's got that style,  
She's got that smile,  
She's got the walk,

Knows what to wear,  
She's got that face,

A penis (pom, pom, pom)  
She's got a penis (pom, pom, pom)

Than most of the dolls.

This babe's a trip,  
She's distingué,  
She's got cachet,  
She's quite a dame,  
Ain't it a shame,  
A crime that's heinous (pom, pom, pom)  
  
Those lips those eyes,  
Then big surprise,  
That penis (pom, pom, pom)  
  
_(Songmaster solo:)_  
There's always some failure,  
Always some flaw,  
Ain't that what they call Murphy's Law?  
But male genitalia,  
That's where I draw the line.  
Besides hers is bigger than mine...  
  
_(Everyone:)_  
She's got class,  
She's got that sass,  
She's got that chic,  
She's got mystique,  
She's cool she's hot,  
She's got a lot,  
Except a mound of Venus (pom, pom, pom)  
  
It's a tragedy,  
But where that should be,  
She's got a penis (pom, pom, pom)  
She had a penis (pom, pom, pom)  
  
_(Songmaster solo:)_  
My life's a mess,  
Cause under that dress,  
She's got a P-E-N-I-S.  
  
_(Everyone:)_  
Yes!  
  
## Clementine  
##### Code: clementine  
  
In a cavern, in a canyon,  
Excavating for a mine,  
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner,  
And his daughter Clementine.  
  
Oh my darling, oh my darling,  
Oh my darling Clementine,  
Thou art lost and gone forever,  
Dreadful sorry Clementine.  
  
Light she was and like a fairy,  
And her shoes were number nine,  
Herring boxes without topses,  
Sandals were for Clementine.  
  
Oh my darling...  
  
Drove she ducklings to the water,  
Every morning just at nine.  
Hit her foot against a splinter,  
Fell into the foaming brine.  
  
Oh my darling...  
  
Saw her lips above the water,  
Blowing bubbles mighty fine.  
But alas – I was non swimmer,  
So I lost my Clementine.  
  
Oh my darling...

Okay! Hey hey!  
Tomorrow's just your future yesterday.  
  
Tell the clock on the wall:forget the wake-up call!  
'Cause the night's not nearly through.  
Wipe the sleep from your eyes, give yourself a surprise,  
Let your worries wait another day!  
And if you stay too late in the bar,  
At least you made it out this far,  
So make up your mind and say:  
Let's do it anyway!  
  
It's okay...  
  
Life's too short to worry about  
The things that you can live without,  
And I regret to say
